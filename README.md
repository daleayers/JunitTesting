# JunitTesting

-How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Testing, testing, testing! Junit is all about testing. In this project, I learned about the many different aspects of testing and how one Junit test can be essential but also could not mean anything if not done correctly. If we write a weak Junit test and it passes the test, then we have not done anything other than confirm our own confirmation bias. Testing to make sure that our code is functional and secure requires discipline, caution, and skill. 

-How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting needs I think, is one of the essential parts of any program. If we cant interpret the user needs, then we have failed right out of the gate. Ideally, we would be able to conduct an interview with the user, understand the requirements for the system, and continually check in with them throughout the development process. Checking in with the user, like Junit, is another form of testing. 

-How do I approach designing software?

Designing software starts with understanding the requirements first. Once we fully understand the requirements, we can decide if the project is even possible with the available resources. Once it is decided that the project is possible, I would approach designing software from an SDLC methodology, continually checking in with the user to make sure that our project meets their requirements and building it in small sprints that are complete and deliverable.
